// Few important points to remember about the unique_lock is as follows:
// 1. The class unique_lock is a mutex ownership wrapper.
// 2. It Allows:
//     a. Can Have Different Locking Strategies
//     b. time-constrained attempts at locking (try_lock_for, try_lock_until)
//     c. recursive locking
//     d. transfer of lock ownership (move not copy)
//     e. condition variables. (See this in coming videos)

// Locking Strategies
//    TYPE  EFFECTS(S)
// 1. defer_lock  do not acquire ownership of the mutex.
// 2. try_to_lock  try to acquire ownership of the mutex without blocking.
// 3. adopt_lock  assume the calling thread already has ownership of the mutex.
